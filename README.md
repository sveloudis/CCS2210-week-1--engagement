# CCS2210-week-1--engagement
In this first engagement, you are required to enter all missing semantic HTML tags!
Once you have completed semantic tagging, the html file should be correctly formatted by the accomapnying css styles.
Although we will cover css later in the unit, please go through the css file and try to make sense how the formatting actually takes place!
